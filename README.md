# cpsc_api_python
Query CPSC recalls by their web API and output a csv of results


This is a quick Python app I made to query recalls issued by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.  Primary focus is on baby related
products since my wife is pregnant.  Feel free to take this and make it work however you wish.
